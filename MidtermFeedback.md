# Work on Citations

NOTE: The notes below were written BEFORE you got your grade back; you could have hit all the points she's talking about

- Only really required to cite the authors, not the actual paper
- Its okay to paraphrase, but be sure to mention the authors. This is so that the Prof knows that you actually understand the paper and didn't just pull some shit out of ol' faithful
- Actually answer the question -> some people who did the gender question didn't answer the part regarding "rewards"
    - For this question, you could have used funding examples, nobel laureate gender disparity, etc.
- Feedback for Mertonian science question: asks about general, AND four norms (luckily I'm pretty sure you hit them both)
    - Regardless, DIRECTLY answer the questions.
- Feedback for Basic Science vs Big Science
    - Cover all your bases basically

- Read the fucking final paper question
