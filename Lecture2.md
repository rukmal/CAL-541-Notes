## Reading Assignments
- Robert Merton: The Normative Structure of Science (The Sociology of Science)
	- Proposed the ideal "ethos" of science as consisting of four qualities:
	1. Universalism
	2. Communism
	3. Disinterestedness
	4. Organized Skepticism

- Boggio, Ballabeni, Hemenway: Basic Research and Knowledge Production Modes - A View from Harvard Medical School

## Merton Norms

### Overview and Background
- Robert Merton proposes the idea of science as a *social institution*.
- This was published in the aftermath of World War II, when Jewish scientists were not allowed to participate in mainstream (read: glorifying) science, and a significant amount of scientific research was kept secret (i.e. manhattan project).
- Defines norms, which are rules/guidelines that help guide the behavior of the participants of the institution.
	- Important caveat: Merton's Norms are *ideal*. That is, he realizes that they will not be accepted/reflected in every scientist, but are rather guidelines for the optimal scientist.
- Acronym: *CUDOS* (Communism, Universalism, Disinterestedness, and Organized Skepticism).

### Universalism Norm
1. Science should be judged for the value of itself.
	- Think: Foregoing institutional bias (i.e. Harvard vs Community College), other biases (such as the fame bias for professors), and evaluation should purely be of the actual underlying science.
2. Scientific careers should be open to all talents. That is, no institutional barriers should exist to an individual wishing to pursue science.
	- Note the historical context at the time - Jewish scientists were not allowed to participate in mainstream science at the time.

### Communism Norm
1. Scientific knowledge belongs to the scientific community.
	- Challenges the prevailing norm at the time for post-WW2 World (eg: Manhattan project).
2. Another interpretation of this Mertonian Norm is that we (i.e. society) should give credit to scientists for their respective discoveries.

### Disinterestedness Norm
We (again, society) should not pursue science for altruism or fame, but rather just for the passion for knowledge).


### Organized Skepticism Norm
Basically, replication of experiments to ensure validity.

However, consider how hard this is to do with capital intensive science research projects? For example:
	- Eg: quantum computing research, which is highly esoteric and requires an absurd amount of equipment to pursue effectively.
	- A result of this replication condition is that it may challenge the Mertonian norm of universalism, as this significantly reduces the number of people that have access and/or the ability to do certain types of science and experiments. This also significantly perpetuates the societal inclination toward certain institutions and professors, merely due to their higher capital affliction. For example, if Harvard were to publish a study on a new, highly esoteric gene therapy, it would be widely accepted and take a long time to replicate due to the (hypothetically) large capital investment required. Thus, this condition may inadvertently impede that of universalism.

## Basic Research and Knowledge Production Modes
- Mertonian Norms violated by commercialization:
1. Disinterestedness
2. Communism

- Definition of *basic science*
	- Science that is performed for the sake of pursuing it (i.e. not goal-driven).

### My Personal Opinion of this Topic (Discussed in class)

At the inception of modern science, purportedly during the time of Copernicus and Newton, the gap between what is defined in these notes as "basic" science, and "applied" science was very large. There was no possible utilization of the laws of Kepler or Newton to normal life. Thus, these fields of study could have been classified as basic. Today however, we use Kepler's laws to navigate the vast expanse of space, and to make our GPS systems function correctly.

Similarly, science that could be defined as "basic" not too long ago is that of the study of the quanta. Today, Feynman's highly theoretical quantum mechanical discoveries are very much applied - specifically in the fields of imaging and quantum computing. This, along with many more examples could be used to illustrate the quickly closing gap between applied and basic science.

In computer science in particular, I believe that this gap is nearly non-existent. New mathematical optimization models are immediately used for practical purposes (thus making them "applied"), despite the pure (i.e. basic) nature of the underlying mathematical discoveries.

Therefore, I would classify this classification of types of science as outdated, as our capability (as a society) to make use of and engineer solutions from ever-more advanced theory makes nearly every new "basic" science discovery immediately "applied".
