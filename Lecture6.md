# Lecture 6 - 2/3/18
# Old and New Science - Small vs. Big Science

## Reading Assignments

- The Meaning of Data - Open and Closed Evidential Cultures in the Search for Gravitational Waves
	- Method: Field research; interviews and email excerpts
	- Value: Collins, while not a Physicist by trade, has spent over 50 years in the field. So, he has a *significantly* better understanding of the field w.r.t. Sociology. This contrasts with the Mertonian approach which - in my opinion - is bullshit.
	- Type: Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)

- The Long Aha! (Chapter 12) - *Gravity's Kiss: The Detection of Gravitational Waves*
	- Winch's View: Once a discovery is published, it is no longer *believed*, but rather becomes a part of the greater body of knowledge.
		- Basically analogized this feat to the difference between the discovery of an individual germ to the development of the germ theory of infection
	- Collins' Fractal Model of Scientific Change: A new *branch* of a larger field is formed when a discovery is made and adopted
		- Eg: When particulate matter was first discovered, it became a new branch off the main *trunk* of Physics as a whole.
	- Argues that the theory of gravitational waves have graduated to a real field, and we can now move on to discovering Winch's *Germs*
	- Proposes a fundamental *shift to replication has been made*,  as an affront to coincidence

## Paradigm Shifts

- Proposed by Thomas Combs
- Recall the Mertonian Heuristic of knowledge growth (y = mx)
- Recall the more *step-function*-esque view of knowledge growth, with a significant discovery advancing the trajectory of the field significantly, followed by a series of more nominal advances, before the next breakthrough.
