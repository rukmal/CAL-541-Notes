# Introduction and Discussion - What is Science? What is Technology? What is Sociology of Science and Technology?

## Sociology

- Sociology can be divided into two categories:
	- Micro-sociology
		- Small social institutions (i.e.classrooms, family, etc.)
	- Macro-sociology
		- *Large* social institutions (i.e. religions, economies, governments, etc.)
- *Social change* offers insight into the relationship between the micro-sociological and macro-sociological institutions.

### Micro-Sociology
- *Symbolic interaction*
	- A frame of reference to better understand how individuals interact with one another to create symbolic words, and in return, how these words shape individual behavior.

### Macro-Sociology
- *Functionalism*
	- The theory that all major and prominent social institutions exist because they are functional to society in some way.
	- Popular in the 1950s and 1960s (i.e. when shit wasn't broken)
	- *Provoking Questions*
		- How is inequality functional?
		- How has the incentive to work harder been functional to society, and not one of its institutions?
	- NOTE: Functionalism does not address *how much* inequality is enough/conducive to optimal utility for society.
- *Conflict Theory*
	- Theory proposed my Karl Marx that causes claims that society is in a state of perpetual conflict, due to competition for limited resources. It holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than consensus and conformity.

## Analyzing Social Theories
There are currently two main paradigms for doing this effectively:
1. Quantitative
	- Questionnaire
	- Experimentation
	- Existing data/archives
	- Caveat: Most people use quantitative data alone, just because it is significantly easier to get.
2. Qualitative
	- Interviews
	- Field research (also called participant observation)
		- eg: Sociologist that followed dude from LIGO (gravitational waves)

### The Use of Human Subjects
Understandably, there are significant ethical considerations that have to be taken into account when going with this method.

Generally speaking, all research (involving human subjects) that is conducted with the intent of being published at some point in the future must first be authorized by an IRB (Institutional Review Board), before further research can proceed. This includes interviews.
